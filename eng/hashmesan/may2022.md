| 5/18/2022 | Setting up relayer environment for issue #84; Having issue with code deployment, and running test cases; They simply hang; I tried with different versions of builder; suspect some version difference, and ask for Ganesha for his package lock files; compare the retargetAlgorithm code, and understand how the system works.            | 8     |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
| 5/19/2022 | Tested the package lock still an issue. Discovered the issue is with the deploy & testing code expecting a new block. So I changed the ganache to produce a new block every two sec.  Modified the test code, and deploy code  to initialize() separately.                                                                                  | 8     |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
| 5/20/2022 | Proceed with analysis, modified the Relay.sol code  spot check the current block to see whether isCorrectDifficultyTarget is working properly.  It seems like it's working properly.  The relayer has 45K+ transactions, too many to go through manually.   So I proceed to write some scripts to query all the relay account transactions. | 8     |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
